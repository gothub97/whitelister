# üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Whitelister

**Whitelister** is an open-source initiative to build a forensic profiler for ERC20 tokens, designed to help compliance teams and auditors evaluate token risk based entirely on on-chain data.

> FBI-style profiling for crypto assets ‚Äî from contract bytecode to wallet relationships.

---

## üöß Project Status

This project is **in early design phase**.
We are currently defining:
- The `TokenComplianceProfile` JSON schema
- The core modules for contract and holder analysis
- The stack architecture (Django API + on-chain extractors)

Implementation is expected to begin soon. Contributions and collaborators are welcome.

---

## üéØ Vision

Whitelister will generate both:
- üî≠ A high-level executive risk overview
- üïµÔ∏è A detailed forensic trace for compliance audits

The output will be a structured JSON profile per token, designed to be LLM/agent-compatible and API-consumable.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package installer)
- PostgreSQL

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/whitelister.git
    cd whitelister
    ```

2.  **Set up the environment:**
    - Create a virtual environment (recommended):
      ```bash
      python -m venv venv
      source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
      ```
    - Create a `.env` file from the example:
      ```bash
      cp whitelister_backend/.env.example whitelister_backend/.env
      ```
    - Update `whitelister_backend/.env` with your PostgreSQL database credentials and any other necessary environment variables (e.g., RPC endpoint for Web3.py if you plan to fetch live on-chain data).

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    This project uses Poetry for managing dependencies, as defined in `pyproject.toml`. The recommended way to install dependencies is using Poetry:
    ```bash
    pip install poetry
    poetry install
    ```
    Alternatively, if you prefer to use pip directly, you will need to manually generate a `requirements.txt` file from the `pyproject.toml` file using a full Poetry installation (`poetry export -f requirements.txt --output requirements.txt --without-hashes`) and then install using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Please note that a `requirements.txt` is not provided in the repository.

4.  **Apply database migrations:**
    If using Poetry:
    ```bash
    poetry run python manage.py migrate
    ```
    If using pip with a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

### Running the Development Server

To start the Django development server:
- If using Poetry:
  ```bash
  poetry run python manage.py runserver
  ```
- If using pip with a virtual environment:
  ```bash
  python manage.py runserver
  ```

The API will typically be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

### Running Tests

To run the test suite:
- If using Poetry:
  ```bash
  poetry run python manage.py test api
  ```
- If using pip with a virtual environment:
  ```bash
  python manage.py test api
  ```
